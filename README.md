##LOOK UP!

###Look Up helps you keep track of the celestial bodies currently above you. The program takes date, time and location information from your client, sends them to [Astronomy API](http://www.astronomyapi.com/), which returns relative information on the planets in our solar system, and tells you which planets are currently above you.

####You do not need to log in to Look Up, but you will need to give your browser permission to access your location information.
